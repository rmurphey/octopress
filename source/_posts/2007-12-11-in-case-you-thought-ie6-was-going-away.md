Microsoft has released <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=21EABB90-958F-4B64-B5F1-73D0A413C8EF&amp;displaylang=en">yet another version</a> (the third, I think) of their timebombed XP/IE6 image for use with their <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/virtualpc/default.mspx">Virtual PC Console</a>. (Why they keep timebombing it is a mystery to me -- it's as if they think one of these days, approximately six months from whenever they release a new version, there won't be a need for IE6 testing anymore.)

I have not a single kind word for IE6, and about the best I can say about IE7 is that a) it sucks less than IE6 and b) some proprietary software I have to use for client work crashes a bit less often in it than in Firefox. That said, both IE6 and IE7 are a fact of life, and it's also a fact of life that Microsoft saw fit to ensure that you can't easily run both side-by side -- which is why you have this whole Virtual PC setup. <em>If</em> you can get the Virtual Machine Additions, Shared Networking, and Shared Folders all to work (at the same time, if you're lucky!), then this is a decent kludge to let you test your sites in IE6.
