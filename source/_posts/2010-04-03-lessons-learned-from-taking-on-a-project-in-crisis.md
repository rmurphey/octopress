<p>I just got done with an emergency project for an agency developing a public-facing application for a mutinational technology client you've most certainly heard of. I developed the entire front-end -- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript -- for a non-trivial application with a limited spec in just seven days. The experience was so eye-opening that I feel the need to write down some of the things I've learned, in hopes that I can benefit from my experience in the future.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Demand all technical source material up front, such as functional specs, mockups, work that's been done to date, etc. Give the client a fixed amount of time to deliver that source material, and don't make a decision about taking on the project until you've seen it. What the client can deliver in that fixed amount of time will shed a lot of light on the state of the project and whether their expectations are realistic.</li>
	<li>Set clear time expectations. Am I willing to work 16 hours a day? Am I expected to? Are there hours during which I'll be expected to be available? Am I willing to work on the weekend?</li>
	<li>Find out whether the client expects me to be available after the imminent deadline, and to what extent. The last thing I want is to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory by being unable to support the code I've written.</li>
	<li>Do not accept responsibility for commitments made on my behalf. The recruiter said I'd be available six hours a day when I told him four? Not my problem. The client committed to having a feature ready for review without consulting me? They probably won't make that mistake again.</li>
	<li>Ascertain the rest of the team's commitment to the project. If I'm expected to work long hours, will they be there during those long hours to get me what I need? Are there any constraints on their availability?</li>
	<li>Establish a single point of contact at the client, and make clear I'll be depending on them to get me any information I need and I'll be treating their decisions as final. Insist that they participate in all calls I'm expected to participate in.</li>
	<li>Limit the amount of work I do before I have access to all client systems I'll need access to: version control, testing environments, ticketing systems, etc.</li>
	<li>Insist on a ticketing system. I'm new to the project and I have a lot to get up to speed on. I don't want emails flying at me from all directions -- decisions and technical requirements need to be documented in a single place that everyone can see. This is my only insurance when someone wants to know why something isn't done, or why it wasn't done the way they expected.</li>
	<li>Insist on version control, even if it's something crappy like CVS. I'll need a way to make sure the rest of the team has access to my latest and greatest. FTP blows, especially when I'm FTPing to a server where another developer is constantly deploying a new build, overwriting my work.</li>
</ul>

<p>What other advice do you have?</p>
