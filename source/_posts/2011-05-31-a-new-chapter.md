<p>It was three years ago this summer that I <a href="http://blog.rebeccamurphey.com/2-years-in-some-thoughts-on-working-for-mysel">got the call, bought the Yuengling, smoked the cigarettes</a>, and began life as an independent consultant. It&rsquo;s been (almost) three years of ups and downs, and, eventually, among the most rewarding experiences of my life. Day by day, I wrote my own job description, found my own clients, set my own schedule, and set my own agenda.</p>

<p>Starting tomorrow, it&rsquo;s time for a new chapter in my working life: I&rsquo;ll be joining <a href="http://toura.com">Toura Mobile</a> full-time as their lead JavaScript developer, continuing my work with them on creating a PhoneGap- and Dojo-based platform for the rapid creation of content-rich mobile applications.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working with Toura for about six months now, starting shortly after I met <a href="http://twitter.com/MattRogish">Matt Rogish</a>, their director of development, at a JavaScript event in New York. They brought me on as a consultant to review their existing application, and the eventual decision was to rewrite it from the ground up, using the lessons learned and knowledge gained from the first version to inform the second. It was a risky decision, but it&rsquo;s paid off: earlier this year, Toura started shipping apps built with the rewritten system, and the care we took to create modular, loosely coupled components from the get-go has paid off immensely, meeting current needs while making it easier to develop new features. With the rewrite behind us, these days we&rsquo;re using the solid foundation we built to allow users of the platform to create ever more customized experiences in their applications.</p>

<p>If you know me at all, you know that I&rsquo;ve been pretty die-hard about being an independent consultant, so you might think this was a difficult decision. Oddly, it wasn&rsquo;t &mdash; I&rsquo;ve enjoyed these last several months immensely, the team I work with is fantastic, and I&rsquo;ve never felt more proud of work I&rsquo;ve done. Whenever I found myself wondering whether Toura might eventually tire of paying my consulting rates, I&rsquo;d get downright mopey. Over the course of three years, I&rsquo;ve worked hard for all of my clients, but this is the first time I&rsquo;ve felt so invested in a project&rsquo;s success or failure, like there was a real and direct correlation between my efforts and the outcome. It&rsquo;s a heady feeling, and I hope and expect it to continue for a while.</p>

<p>By the way, I&rsquo;ll be talking about the rewrite at both <a href="http://2011.texasjavascript.com">TXJS</a> and <a href="http://gothamjs.com">GothamJS</a> in the next few weeks.</p>
