I've been juggling 1.5 jobs for the last few weeks, but starting Monday it's back down to one, but a new one: I'll be doing front-end development for <a href="http://www.dailystrength.org">DailyStrength.org</a>, which will hopefully give me plenty of front-end goodness to write about again. For all two of you paying attention to this site, sorry for the blackout.
