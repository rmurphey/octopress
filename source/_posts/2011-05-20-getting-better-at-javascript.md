I seem to be getting a lot of emails these days asking a deceptively simple
question: “How do I get better at JavaScript?” What follows are some
semi-random thoughts on the subject:

The thing that I’ve come to realize about these questions is that some things
just take time. I wish I could write down “Ten Things You Need to Know to Make
You Amazing at the JavaScript,” but it doesn’t work that way. Books are
fantastic at exposing you to guiding principles and patterns, but if your brain
isn’t ready to connect them with real-world problems, it won’t.

**The number one thing that will make you better at writing JavaScript is writing
JavaScript.** It’s OK if you cringe at it six months from now. It’s OK if you
know it could be better if you only understood X, Y, or Z a little bit better.
[ Cultivate dissatisfaction ](http://www.paulgraham.com/taste.html), and fear the day when you aren’t disappointed with
the code you wrote last month.

Encounters with new concepts are almost always eventually rewarding, but in the
short term I’ve found they can be downright demoralizing if you’re not aware of
the bigger picture. The first step to being better at a thing is realizing you
could be better at that thing, and initially that realization tends to involve
being overwhelmed with all you don’t know. The first [ JSConf ](http://jsconf.us/2009/), in 2009, was
exactly this for me. I showed up eager to learn but feeling pretty cocky about
my skills. I left brutally aware of the smallness of my knowledge, and it was a
transformational experience: getting good at a thing involves seeking out
opportunities to feel small.

One of the most helpful things in my learning has been having access to smart
people who are willing to answer my questions and help me when I get stuck.
Meeting these people and maintaining relationships with them is hard work, and
it generally involves interacting with them in real life, not just on the
internet, but the dividends of this investment are unfathomable.

To that end, attend conferences. Talk to the speakers and ask them questions.
Write them emails afterwards saying that it was nice to meet them. Subscribe to
their blogs. Pay attention to what they’re doing and evangelize their good
work.

Remember, too, that local meetups can be good exposure to new ideas too, even
if on a smaller scale. The added bonus of local meetups is that the people
you’ll meet there are … local! It’s easy to maintain relationships with them
and share in learning with them in real life.

(An aside: If your company won’t pay for you to attend any conferences, make
clear how short-sighted your company’s decision is and start looking for a new
job, because your company does not deserve you. Then, if you can, cough up the
money and go anyway. As a self-employed consultant, I still managed to find
something like $10,000 to spend on travel- and conference-related expenses last
year, and I consider every penny of it to be money spent on being better at
what I do. When I hear about big companies that won’t fork over even a fraction
of that for an employee who is raising their hand and saying “help me be better
at what I do!”, I rage.)

Make a point of following the bug tracker and repository for an active
open-source project. Read the bug reports. Try the test cases. Understand the
commits. I admit that I have never been able to make myself do this for
extended periods of time, but I try to drop in on certain projects now and then
because it exposes me to arbitrary code and concepts that I might not otherwise
run into.

Read the source for your favorite library, and refer to it when you need to
know how a method works. Consult the documentation when there’s some part of
the source you don’t understand. When choosing tools and plugins, read the
source, and see whether there are things you’d do differently.

Eavesdrop on communities, and participate when you have something helpful to
add. Lurk on a mailing list or a forum or in an IRC channel, help other people
solve problems. If you’re not a [ help vampire ](http://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/) — if you give more than you take —
the “elders” of a community will notice, and you will be rewarded with their
willingness to help you when it matters.

Finally, books:

- JavaScript: The Good Parts, by Douglas Crockford. It took me more than one
  try to get through this not-very-thick book, and it is not gospel. However,
  it is mandatory reading for any serious JavaScript developer.
- [ Eloquent JavaScript ](http://eloquentjavascript.net/), Marijn Haverbeke (also in print). This is another book
  that I consider mandatory; you may not read straight through it, but you
  should have it close at hand. I like it so much that I actually bought the
  print version, and then was lucky enough to get a signed copy from Marijn at
  JSConf 2011.
- JavaScript Patterns, by Stoyan Stefanov. This was the book that showed me
  there were names for so many patterns that I’d discovered purely through
  fumbling around with my own code. I read it on the flight to the 2010 Boston
  jQuery Conference, and it’s definitely the kind of book that I wouldn’t have
  gotten as much out of a year earlier, when I had a lot less experience with
  the kinds of problems it addresses.
- Object-Oriented JavaScript, by Stoyan Stefanov. It’s been ages since I read
  this book, and so I confess that I don’t have a strong recollection of it,
  but it was probably the first book I read that got me thinking about
  structuring JavaScript code beyond the “get some elements, do something with
  them” paradigm of jQuery.

Good luck.
