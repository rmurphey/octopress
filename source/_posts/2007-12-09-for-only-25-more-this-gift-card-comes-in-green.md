title: For only $25 more, this gift card comes in green
comments: true

I was just at the online Apple store to buy an iTunes gift card for my mother (who hopefully will not be reading this blog) -- when you arrive from iTunes, it drops you on a page where you can choose from a variety of gift card designs. On this screen, it seems that there is a 1:1 relationship between colors and denominations -- for example, the $25 card only comes in red.

I picked my denomination, and was taken to a page where I could enter a personalized message. Below that, I was offered the opportunity to "change theme":

<div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
<img alt="" src="http://blog.rebeccamurphey.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/itunes-change-theme.png" />
</div>


I wasn't much a fan of the red, so I clicked to choose the green, entered my personalized message, and clicked add to cart -- and only then did I find out that changing the theme also changed my order to a more expensive card. That's either extremely poor design, or extremely sketchy.
