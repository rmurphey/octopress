Over the past several months, I've been on a [few][sass-bites] [different][developer-tea-1] [podcasts][motherboard], plus I've been having a lot of fun doing [office hours][office-hours], and generally talking a lot with other people who do the kind of work that I do. I've particulary enjoyed talking about a subject that Alex Sexton dubbed [Front-End Ops][feops].

It has occurred to me that a) I'm really super fortunate to get to have conversations about this stuff with super-smart people; b) there aren't yet a lot of great sources of information about front-end ops in the real world; and c) I used to be on a [podcast][yayquery] and that sure was fun.

To that end, I threw a tweet out into the world to see who might be willing to talk to me and let me record the conversation. I got enough great responses that I decided to don my podcasting hat again for a little bit, and the result is the [TTL Podcast][ttl-podcast].

If you're a mid-level front-end dev looking to level up, I'd humbly suggest that this is very much a show for you -- you'll get to listen in on the thought process of some of the best front-end devs I know. That said, it's not just a show for those aspiring to take the front-end world by storm; it's also a chance for those who are already in the trenches, doing daily battle with WebDriver and trying to shave 10 more milliseconds off page load, to commiserate asynchronously. I know I personally have learned a ton -- in some cases I've seen a new angle on a problem, and in other cases I've had some serious Developer Guilt assuaged.

I've released three episodes so far -- conversations with Alex, Burak YiÄŸit Kaya (Disqus), and Daniel Espeset and Seth Walker (Etsy). More episodes are in the pipeline, including developers from Walmart Labs, Yammer, FT Labs, and The Guardian.

While the initial focus has been on front-end ops, I can see the scope widening over time to cover, generally, the tools and challenges of doing front-end dev at significant scale. If you or someone you know would be a good person to talk to about that sort of thing, I hope you'll [let me know][email].

While I'm here, I want to give huge and sincere thanks to [SauceLabs][saucelabs] and [Travis CI][travisci] for their support of the show; to [Una Kravets][una] for finding time in her busy life to make me a website; to my sister, who's been kind enough to pitch in with the editing; and to [Bazaarvoice][bv] for giving me the freedom to take on a project like this.
