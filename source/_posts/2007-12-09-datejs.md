Forgot about coming across <a href="http://www.datejs.com/">DateJS</a> in one of my feeds the other day. Haven't used it yet, but expect I will next time I have to do much of anything with user date input. I'll be especially happy if it does end up getting <a href="http://marcgrabanski.com/article/90/DateJS-JavaScript-Library">integrated with the  jQuery UI datepicker ...</a>.
